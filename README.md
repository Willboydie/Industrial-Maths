# Industrial-Maths
This course involved two consultancy-style projects. For detailed information on the assignments and the motivation behind the code, look no further than the (very brief) final submissions themselves, included in the repo as pdf files.

## Metal Quenching
The first project was to reccomend a metal quenching strategy to a blacksmith company. What is the most efficient and effective strategy for quenching hot metal?

### Metal_Quenching (2).pdf
The project submission. A consultancy-style report discussing our findings and recommending a strategy.

### Metal Quenching-checkpoint.ipynb
My code. Simulating a sword being quenched by solving the heat equations in 2D.

## Opinions Model
The second project was to recommend an optimal persuasion strategy to an advertising firm/political party, based on a simple but commonly used opinion behaviour model. How best can you persuade the populus?

The project submission. A consultancy-style report discussing our findings and recommending a strategy.

### MAGA-checkpoint.ipynb
My code. Based on a simple mathematical opinion algorithm, however a model with many added features to improve its quality as a simulation of real opinion behaviour, and to give options for exploring and answering more specific questions related to advertising and politics. For instance, the addition of randomness (brownian motion), advertising agents with a "charisma" score, the ability to test advertiser strategy, etc.
