# Industrial-Maths
Code from my industrial mathematics module during 4th year of university. Some very fun model-making/simulation problems. Contains two projects: A metal quenching simulation, and an opinion model.

For detailed information on the assignments and the motivation behind the code, look no further than the (very brief and concise, consultancy-style) final submissions themselves, included in the repo as pdf files.
