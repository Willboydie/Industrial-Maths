# Industrial-Maths
Code from my industrial mathematics module during 4th year of university. Some very fun model-making/simulation problems. Contains two projects: A metal quenching simulation, and an opinion model.

For detailed information on the assignments and the motivation behind the code, look no further than the final submissions themselves, included in the repo as pdf files.
